		<h1>Kamila Dottin</h1>
		<p> I'm making a major career change from Production Management in the Fashion Industry to UI UX Design. I am super excited about this change and I feel like at this point in my life, a change is well needed! I like the idea of a relaxed enviornment and the constant change of learning new things. It will be very hard for me to get bored easily by redundancy. In these images you will see gowns that I produced with factories and staff. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>

		<h3>Production Life Cycle</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In a production life cycle, you work with a team of designers and the sales people showcases the designs to the buyers. The buyers then picks which ever items they like.</li>
			<li>Typically, production takes 6 months to complete goods which includes producing the fabric, making the patterns, sewing, and shipping.</li>
			<li>Producing the fabric with the fabric mill will generally take 1 month to complete(depending on the fabric).</li>
			<li>While the fabric is going through it's producing stage, we are making fitting samples and making correction to the pattern to have a perfect designer fit.</li>
			<li>Once factory has received fabric from the mill, it goes through fabric inspection and then garment goes through what is called the pre-production stage (PPS). We do as many fitting as it takes to prefect the fit. Once the PPS is approved, factory may then cut the lot and this should take any where from 2-4weeks to complete.</li>
			<li>At this point, we've reached the final stage of approvals we require a Top of Production sample (TOP). This sample comes from the beginning on the final stage to ensure we are getting what we made approvals on. </li>
			<li> The only thing left to do is ship the goods! To save money on the cost of goods, we ship them via boat which generally takes 35-40days. We then have our warehouse clear the goods at the port, an at that point, the goods are off loaded from the containers, and hung in the warehouse and from there the warehouse workers ship the good to the department store.</li>
