			<h3>Community Circle</h3>
			<p>
				Giving back is always a great way to support our communities. Lets contribute to our communities by creating teams for our youth so we may keep them out of trouble. Let's grab a bag and hit our community parks in efforts to help keep them clean.  There's so many ways we can help. The Possibilities are endless!

			<h3>Helping Out</h3>
			<p>
				Before the industrial revolution, it was common for men to spend much of their day in the company of their sons—either on the family farm or in the family business. In those settings, dads could teach their sons practical lessons as well as the lessons of leadership, protection, and provision expected of manhood.

			<h3>Model Citizens</h3>
			<p>
				Today, work, school, extracurricular activities, and even church take fathers and sons in separate directions. Dads, therefore, have to be intentional about creating opportunities to teach their sons—to model manhood.
