These cookies were packaged in wax paper bags, sealed with a sticker, and sold door to door for 25 to 35 cents per dozen (ibid.).</p>
	<p>
	Today, Girl Scout Cookies are still a major fundraiser for its local troops.  Profit from Cookie sales amounts to 70% of consumer cost.  Cookie sale revenue is used to subsidize Girl Scout programs in the local areas for such activities as recruiting and training volunteer leaders, improving and maintaining camp and other activity sites, keeping event/camp fees for all members to a minimum, and sponsoring special events and projects (ibid.).</p></strong>

	<p><strong>Perhaps one of the most well known fundraisers involving children is the Girl Scouts of the USA and its Girl Scout Cookies campaign.  Girl Scout Cookies had their start in the kitchens of its members, with mothers volunteering to make the cookies.  The sale of cookies to finance troop activities began with the the Mistletoe Troop in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which baked cookies and sold them in its high school cafeteria in December 1917 (Girl Scouts).</p></strong>

	<p><strong>In July 1922, The American Girl magazine, published by Girl Scout national headquarters, featured an article by Florence E. Neil who provided a cookie recipe that was given to the council's 2,000 Girl Scouts. She estimated the cost of ingredients for six- to seven-dozen cookies to be 26 to 36 cents. The cookies, she suggested, could be sold by troops for 25 or 30 cents per dozen (ibid.).</p></strong>
